# While Loop Independent Practice
- Create two files, while.html and script.js
- Add the jQuery CDN and have a single empty <div> in the HTML file.
- In the script.js file create a while loop that counts from 1 to 100.
- Apend the number to the blank HTML <div> so that the number can show up on the HTML page.
